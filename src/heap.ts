/**
 * These functions implement a min heap which can be used to pop the lowest
 * key.  It uses an array as the heap, and each row in the heap must be an
 * array with the key as the first element:
 * 
 * heap: [number, ...T][]
 * 
 * The main thing to keep in mind is that a heap sort just ensures that the
 * parent key <= child keys, it won't be in ascending order. 
 * 
 * The >> operator is the bit shift operator.  It's used to calculate the index
 * of the parent of a node.  This is one of the unique characteristics of a
 * heap -- no pointers are needed to keep track of child or parent indexes,
 * the structure of the heap itself determines that:
 * 0 root
 * 1 parent 0
 * 2 parent 0
 * 3 parent 1
 * 4 parent 1
 * 5 parent 2
 * 6 parent 2
 * 7 parent 3
 * 
 * parent(7) = 7 >> 1 = 3 (0111 >> 1 = 0011)
 * children(2) = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 and 5 + 1
